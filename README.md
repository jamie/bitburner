# **SPOILERS AHEAD**

This repo contains some scripts I've found useful while playing [Bitburner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) ([steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/)), an incremental programming game.

"Incremental" implies that there are layers to the experience, starting with building scripts to generate cash to buy augmentations, then resetting your progress with those augmentations to do more of the same, and then... SPOILERS.

Click through the source at your peril.
